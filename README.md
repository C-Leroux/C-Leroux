A battle opposes the Resistance to the malevolent organization Aphelion, and an entire solar system is at stake.
This is a tower defense/roguelite game, with a randomly-generated solar system, in which you can build your own set of towers to defend planets from the enemies.

Use your hook to fly through the environment, and kill a maximum number of colossus in a limited time.
This project put the focus on the grappling mechanic. The goal was to make the player movements as fun as possible.

## Conscious Chess (proto)
![Conscious Chess](/images/consciouschess.png)

This seems to be like classic chess... until your pieces start to move on their own! Each piece has its own personality, and will not follow your orders if you force them to do something they don't like. Will you be able to adapt your strategy to comply to their whirm?
